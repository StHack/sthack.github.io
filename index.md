Sthack was first held in 2011. The event takes place in Bordeaux and was first an overnight security contest. It was born from the desire of its founders to have a local CTF and to combine security and epicurean lifestyle.

It now provides 24 hours of an interesting atmosphere for open discussions about security with speakers from all around the world.

Sthack is one of the main security event in Aquitaine (and France :D), with high quality line up of speakers !

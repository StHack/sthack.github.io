## CTF

"Capture the Flag" is a kind of compeon where people can practice offensive IT security. The "Flags" are passwords participants can obtain after having successfully exploited vulnerabilities in applications specifically developed for the challenge, they simulate confidential information. The Flags cost points, and the team that earns the most of point win the compeon.

At Sthack, teams are made up of 5 members max which fight for 12 hours. The points are calculated taking account of the teams that hack the challenge (Chall01 = 50\*(NbTeams-NbTeamsThatSolvedChall01)). You can expect web applications, network forensic, reverse engineering, [steganography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) and software exploitation.
